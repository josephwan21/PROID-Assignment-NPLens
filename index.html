           data-name="Oscilloscope"
           data-year="80s-90s-2000s"
           data-desc="An oscilloscope is essentially a 'graphing machine' for electricity. While a standard multimeter tells you the voltage of a circuit with a single number, an oscilloscope draws a picture of that voltage over time. This allows students and engineers to see waveforms—the pulses, vibrations, and signals that make modern technology work.">

           data-year="Developed in 1953"
           data-desc="This artifact is a portable 16mm film projector, a piece of technology that served as the primary medium for visual education in schools before the advent of VHS tapes and digital projectors. In a school setting, this machine would have been used to show everything from science documentaries and historical newsreels to safety training films. The projector was developed in 1953 in Osaka and was used to screen and review all films produced by Year 2 and 3 FSV students, since the first cohort. The advent of the digital format made this projector obsolete from 2000.">

           data-desc="The capsule was created during a major turning point for the school. By its 25th year in 1988, NP had grown from a small private college with only 116 students in 1963 to a major public institution with over 10,000 students across six academic departments. Dr. Tay Eng Soon noted that by the time the capsule was to be opened in 2013, the world would be 'drastically different,' specifically predicting the massive transformation that technology and computers would bring to the campus.">

           data-desc="The devices featured, such as the Casio Cassiopeia and various Palm-style PDAs, were the first widely adopted 'pocket computers.' Very popular up to the early 2000s, PDAs (Personal Digital Assistant) served as portable electronic organisers. Responding to growing demand for software on these handheld computers, ICT launched the Diploma in IT course in 2002 to train students to develop applications on PDA platforms such as Palm, Psion and the CassioPea. Examples included two-way messaging, 2D games, and an Open House registration application on PDAs. Today, smartphones have far superior functionalities and interfaces. As part of ICT's mobile application development curriculum, we continue to impart these skills through the latest iOS, Android and Windows Mobile platforms.">
